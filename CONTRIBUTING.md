# Contributing to Kei Agents

We welcome contributions! Please follow these guidelines.

## Docs-only Repository

This is a docs-only repository: it defines agent capabilities/tool schemas and
semantic mappings, and must never add provider clients or credential
resolution. Provider execution and customer data retrieval happen in the
tenant-side distributed proxy; ABAC is a policy decision point only. Before
editing architecture or contracts documentation, follow the instructions in
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) (search the wiki first, read the canonical tenant-side
proxy architecture, coordinate via the wiki, and do not duplicate shared
contracts or migrations).

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/kei-agents.git`

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
